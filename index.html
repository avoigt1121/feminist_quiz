  "Rosa Parks": `
    <p>You are quiet strength personified. Like Rosa Parks, you know that standing your ground — even in small, deliberate moments — can create ripples that change the course of history.
      She is best known for her refusal to move from her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in defiance of Jim Crow racial segregation laws, in 1952, which sparked the Montgomery bus boycott.
       She is sometimes known as the "mother of the civil rights movement". [Wikipedia]

  "Marie Curie": `
    <p>You are curious, brilliant, and tireless in the pursuit of knowledge. Like Marie Curie, you see obstacles as challenges to be solved, 
      and your discoveries and ideas make the world better for everyone. 
      Marie was a Polish and naturalised-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, 
      the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery 
      of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes. Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into 
      the treatment of neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes. During World War I, she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals.

  "Eleanor Roosevelt": `
    <p>You are a compassionate leader and a champion for human rights. Like Eleanor Roosevelt, you believe in lifting up others, speaking truth even when it’s difficult, 
      and creating change through understanding.
      Eleanor was an American political figure, diplomat, and activist. Through her travels, public engagement, and advocacy, she largely redefined the role. 
      She served as a United States delegate to the United Nations General Assembly and took a leading role in designing the text and gaining international support 
      for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. President Harry S. Truman later called her the "First Lady of the World" in tribute to her human rights achievements.
After discovering her husband's affair, both partners started to keep independent agendas, and Eleanor joined the Women's Trade Union League and became active in the New York state Democratic Party.
After FDR acquired a paralytic illness, Eleanor regularly made public appearances on his behalf; and as first lady, while her husband served as president, she greatly influenced the present 
scope and future of the role. Roosevelt was, in her time, one of the world's most widely admired and powerful women.
 Nevertheless, in her early years in the White House she was controversial for her outspokenness, particularly with respect to her promotion of civil rights for African Americans. [Wikipedia]

  "Jane Goodall": `
    <p>You are deeply empathetic and endlessly curious about the living world. Like Jane Goodall, you understand that every action counts and that kindness toward all creatures can 
      shape a better future. Jane is an English zoologist, primatologist and anthropologist.
      She is considered the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees, after 60 years' studying the social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees. 
      Goodall first went to Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania to observe its chimpanzees in 1960.
She is the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and the Roots & Shoots programme and has worked extensively on conservation and animal welfare issues. 
As of 2022, she is on the board of the Nonhuman Rights Project.
In April 2002, she was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace. Goodall is an honorary member of the World Future Council. [Wikipedia]

  "Jane Austen": `
    <p>You are witty, insightful, and keenly aware of human nature. Like Jane Austen, you see the humor and beauty in life’s social dance,
       and your words and observations reveal truths others often overlook. Jane was an English novelist known primarily for her six novels, 
       which implicitly interpret, critique, and comment on the English landed gentry at the end of the 18th century.
Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage for the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. 
Her works are implicit critiques of the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.
Her use of social commentary, realism, wit, and irony have earned her acclaim amongst critics and scholars. [Wikipedia]
